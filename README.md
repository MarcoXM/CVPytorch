### Keras ：![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=done)

### Pytorch： ![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=done)

### Tensorflow 2.0 ： ![](http://progressed.io/bar/0?title=done)
##### Umh... The code would uses tensorflow 2.0, Once RC version released, I would update as soon as possible.
```python
import tensorflow.keras as tf
```


These **python/Pytorch** scripts based on the Udacity deep-learning courses. And I have rewrited these with **TensorFlow and Keras.**

And I have take some chinese notes and comments to have better interpretations.
